		<!-- <h3>Guidlines</h3> -->

		<p>Tim and I are always looking for great videos to feature. We watch every submission that comes in the door and if you'd like to submit a different kind of live event film we'd love to see it! Before you submit though, we would like you to keep a few things in mind:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Submit one film at a time and not more than one a month.</li>
			<li>No copyright material. All music must be fully licensed and you must include song title(s), artist name(s) and where you licensed the music.</li>
			<li>If at all possible host your film on Vimeo. We won't reject a submission just because it isn't but we massively prefer Vimeo.</li>
			<li>Try to keep submissions under 8 minutes.</li>
			<li>The event being filmed has to have happened in the past 12 months.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>These things just make everyones life easier. If your submission doesn't meet these guidlines the likelihood that we will look at it is unfortunately very low. If it does however, we will watch it and get back to you as soon as we can. As always thank you for being a part of this community and please reach out to us in the comments section!</p>
